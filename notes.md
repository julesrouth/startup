# The Console

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Command line crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line)

Before the creation of graphical user interfaces, all computing systems were simple console environments consisting as of a prompt for inputting a command and the display of the command output. All of the original programming tools ran as console application. The console tradition is still actively used by professional developers and most programming tools execute within a console window.

Also known as the command line, shell, or terminal, the console window is an essential web development tool. The console provides access to the file system and allows for the execution of command line applications.

There are many console applications that you can chose from. All operating systems come with a default console, but you will probably want to install one in order to get the best experience. Here is an example of [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) running on a Mac.

![Warp](warp.png)

## Make sure you have a console application

In order for you to successfully use the console for web programming it must be [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant. POSIX compliance means that it supports a standard set of console commands. Both Mac and Linix support POSIX. That means any necessary console commands will work on those operating systems.

## Getting a console application for Windows

If you are using Microsoft Windows you can get a reasonable approximation of a POSIX compliant console by installing [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win). When installing use all the default settings.

Once it is installed, hit the Windows button on your keyboard, and type `Git Bash`. This should open a console window that looks something like the following. Make sure you look for the `Git Bash` icon so that you don't accidentally use an non-POSIX compatible console application.

![Git Bash](gitBash.jpg)

⚠ Do not use `Git Command`, `cmd`, or `Powershell`. That will not work for the commands and scripts we run in this class.

You can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) (e.g Ubuntu on Windows) for your work in this class, but you must be very careful to do all of your work actually within WSL. Don't download files to your Windows partition and then access them from WSL. It is suggested that you use `Git Bash` instead of WSL, unless you are really familiar with WSL.

### Testing your console application

Once you have a acceptable console application on your development computer, open it up and make sure you can run a simple POSIX compliant command such as `printf 'hello\n'`.

![Console printf](consolePrintf.jpg)

If this displays `hello` then you are on the right track. If that doesn't work then you are using a console application that is not POSIX compliant. For example, Windows Powershell will not work.

## Viewing the file system

One of the primary purposes of a console application is to view the files on the computer. The files on a computer are organized into a tree structure of nodes called directories. At any given point in time your console is located at one of the directories in the file system. You can see which directory you are in with the `pwd` (present working directory) command.

```sh
➜  pwd

/Users/student/byu//webprogramming260
```

You can list all of the files in the directory with `ls` (list files). Most command line applications take parameters that are specified after you type the application name. For example, `ls` can list all files (even hidden ones) in a long format if you provide the parameter `-la`.

```sh
➜ ls -la

total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 lee  staff   1.0K Nov 19 08:47 LICENSE
-rw-r--r--  1 lee  staff    82B Nov 19 08:47 README.md
drwxr-xr-x  4 lee  staff   128B Nov 19 08:48 profile
drwxr-xr-x  4 lee  staff   128B Nov 19 08:47 react
```

## Executing commands

The other primary purpose of the console is to execute commands. You already did this in the previous section when you executed commands for working with the file system. However, console commands can perform many different operations. Here are some basic commands that you show experiment with.

- **echo** - Output the parameters of the command
- **cd** - Change directory
- **mkdir** - Make directory
- **rmdir** - Remove directory
- **rm** - Remove file(s)
- **mv** - Move file(s)
- **cp** - Copy files
- **ls** - List files
- **curl** - Command line client URL browser
- **grep** - Regular expression search
- **find** - Find files
- **top** - View running processes with CPU and memory usage
- **df** - View disk statistics
- **cat** - Output the contents of a file
- **less** - Interactively output the contents of a file
- **wc** - Count the words in a file
- **ps** - View the currently running processes
- **kill** - Kill a currently running process
- **sudo** - Execute a command as a super user (admin)
- **ssh** - Create a secure shell on a remote computer
- **scp** - Securely copy files to a remote computer
- **history** - Show the history of commands
- **ping** - Check if a website is up
- **tracert** - Trace the connections to a website
- **dig** - Show the DNS information for a domain
- **man** - Look up a command in the manual

You can also chain the input and output of commands using special characters

- `|` - Take the output from the command on the left and _pipe_, or pass, it to the command on the right
- `>` - Redirect output to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists
- `>>` - Redirect output to a file. Appends if the file exists

For example, you can list the files in a directory, pipe it into `grep` to search for files created in Nov, and then pipe that into `wc` to count the number of files found with a date of Nov.

```
ls -l | grep ' Nov ' | wc -l
```

There are also keystrokes that have special meaning in the console.

- `CTRL-R` - Use type ahead to find previous commands
- `CTRL-C` - Kill the currently running command

## ☑ Assignment

Experiment with console commands. Open a console window and create a test directory that you can play with by executing the command `mkdir test` (make directory). Then execute the command `cd test` to change into that directory. Then execute the following sequence of commands:

```sh
mkdir test
cd test
pwd
ls
ls -la
ls ../
printf "x" > test.txt
ls -l
cat test.txt
cp test.txt other.txt
ls
cat test.txt >> other.txt
rm test.txt
less other.txt # press `q` to exit less
for i in {1..2}; do printf 'y' >> other.txt; done;
```

Once you have done this, go over to the assignments page in Canvas and submit the text that results from running `cat other.txt`.

The better you get at working with the console the more efficient your programming will be.

# Git

![Git Icon](essentialsGitIcon.png)

[Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the creator of Linux, was fed up with the proprietary version control software that he was using to track the code for the Linux kernel and so over a weekend he built Git, the world's most popular version control system.

## Installing Git

Before we can talk about Git you need to make sure it is installed in your development environment. Open a console and type `git --version`.

```sh
➜  git --version
git version 2.32.0 (Apple Git-132)
```

If you do not see something like that, then you need to follow these [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git.

## What is Git?

Git provides two valuable functions. First, it allows you to track versions of files in a directory. Second, it allows you to clone all of those versions to a different location, usually to a different computer. We are going to focus on tracking versions in this instruction and cover cloning repositories when we talk later about GitHub.

You can track file versions of any files in a directory by initializing Git for that directory. You can do this right now by creating a new directory in a console window and initializing it as a Git repository.

```sh
➜  mkdir playingWithGit
➜  cd playingWithGit
➜  git init
```

If you list all files in the directory you will see that you now have a hidden directory named `.git`.

```sh
➜  ls -la
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   3 lee  staff    96 Dec  1 22:59 .
drwxr-xr-x+ 54 lee  staff  1728 Dec  1 23:00 ..
drwxr-xr-x   9 lee  staff   288 Dec  1 22:59 .git
```

The `.git` directory is where all of the versions get stored. Now use the `echo` command to create a file so that we can see how versioning works. After creating the new file, use `git status` to tell you what git is doing.

```sh
➜ echo hello world > hello.txt
➜ git status

On branch master
No commits yet
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
 hello.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

`git status` tells you that it detects a new file named `hello.txt`, but it isn't currently tracking versions for that file. To begin tracking versions you need to add it. Usually you track all files in a repository directory and so you can tell Git to track everything that it doesn't know about with `git add .`. Make sure you include the period at the end of the command. Follow the add command with another call to `git status` in order to see what the repo looks like now.

```sh
➜  git add .
➜  git status

On branch master
No commits yet
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
 new file:   hello.txt
```

Now Git tells us that it has _staged_ the file `hello.txt`, meaning it is ready to be committed as a version in the repository. We commit a version with the `commit` command. We always want to have a meaningful comment about the version we are committing and so we use the `-m` parameter to provide a message that will live with the version. Follow this with another call to `git status`.

```sh
➜  git commit -m "initial draft"
[master (root-commit) d43b07b] initial draft
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt

➜  git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Congratulations! You have just committed your first file to a Git repository. It is important to note that we were only working with a single file in this example. However, a commit can represent multiple files. You just need to add them all before you execute the commit. Also, note that the point of the stage, `git add` step, is so that you can commit some files while still leaving other modified files out of the commit. Only files you've staged will be committed.

Let's make an edit to our file and commit it again. This time we will tell Git that we want to add all the modified tracked files to our commit, without having to `git add` them again, by including the `-a` parameter along with our message parameter.

```sh
➜  echo goodbye world > hello.txt

➜  git commit -am "changed greeting to reflect the present mood"

[master e65f983] changed greeting to reflect the present mood
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Now that we have a couple versions in our repository we can view the versions with the `git log` command.

```sh
➜  git log

commit e65f9833ca8ee366d0d9c1676a91b1a977dab441 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Lee
Date:   Thu Dec 1 23:32:22 2022 -0700

    changed greeting to reflect the present mood

commit d43b07b8890f52defb31507211ba78785bf6dccf
Author: Lee
Date:   Thu Dec 1 23:29:11 2022 -0700

    initial draft
```

This shows both commits with the associated comments.

## Commit SHA

Every commit has a unique identifier that is generated by hashing the file along with the timestamp using the SHA hashing algorithm. You can always refer to a specific commit in your version history by using its SHA. For example, if we want to temporarily switch back to a previous version to see what it contains we can use the `checkout` command. You only need to provide the first few characters of the SHA.

```sh
➜  git checkout d43b07b8890f

Note: switching to 'd43b07b8890f'.
HEAD is now at d43b07b initial draft

➜  cat hello.txt
hello world
```

The above output omits a big message saying that you are no longer looking at the latest version, but the important thing is that you can see that we are now looking at our old version. Note that you don't want to make commits at this point since it will create a branch that is not for the latest code. To get back to the top of the version chain, use the `checkout` command and reference the branch name, which is by default `master`.

```sh
➜  git checkout master
Previous HEAD position was d43b07b initial draft
Switched to branch 'master'

➜  cat hello.txt
goodbye world
```

Now we are back to our latest version.

The following diagram shows how your commits move from your working directory, to staging them for a commit, and then committing them to a repository.

![Git stage](essentialsGitStage.jpg)

A commit is a full snapshot of what was staged from your directory at the time of the commit. That means all of the files contained in the commit were reverted when you executed the checkout command. Since we only had one file in our commit, it looks like we are only flipping that file around, but basically you can think of it as a time machine for the entire directory.

## Diff

Most of the time you don't want to reverse back to an earlier commit. Instead you just want to compare the differences between commits. We can do that with the `diff` command. You can specify two SHAs that you would like to compare, or you can use the `HEAD` variable, which always points to the commit you're currently looking at. To refer to earlier commits you just add `~` and the numerical distance from `HEAD` that you want to reference. In this case we will compare `HEAD` and `HEAD~1`.

```sh
➜  git diff HEAD HEAD~1
```

```diff
diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
index 3b18e51..eeee2af 100644
--- a/hello.txt
+++ b/hello.txt
@@ -1 +1 @@
-hello world
+goodbye world
```

You can see that we made a change to `hello.txt` by removing `hello world` and adding `goodbye world`.

## Branches

Git supports the ability to branch your code. This allows you to work on variations of the code while still allowing progress on the main branch. For example, if you wanted to work on a new feature named `A` without interrupting work on the master branch, you would use the `git branch A` command to create a new branch named `A`, then start working on the new branch with the `git checkout A` command. Now commits can be done to either the `master` branch or the `A` branch. When you want to combine the work done on both branches, you checkout the `master` branch and execute `git merge A`. If you decide you want to abandon the new feature, then you just don't ever merge it back into the master branch.

Here is a demonstration of this working on the visualization tool provided by [git-school.github.io](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/).

![Branches](essentialsBranching.gif)

## Commit often

You will be required to have at least 4 commits for each project that you submit in order to get full credit. Commonly, this will be an initial commit that contains empty project files, followed by commits at each functional milestone, and then a final commit for the working project. Committing your code often is an important practice for you to develop. It protects you from losing your work, allows access from anywhere, makes it so you can quickly share changes, reduces conflicts with your peers, and enables you to efficiently explore different possibilities. This also enables others to review the progression of your development efforts in order to prove the originality of your work.

Remember to make meaningful commit messages that describe the **what** and **why** of the changes made. Here is a [good post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) on how to make meaningful commit messages.

## Binary files

You can store any type of file in Git, but be aware that if you store large binary files, such as images or videos, you are storing a copy of that file each time you make a change to it. For example, suppose you use Git to track the changes you make to a video production project. Every time you save a change to your 10 GB video file you store a complete copy of the file. That means 10 commits of the video file will store 100 GB of data in your repository.

## VS Code and Git

Knowing how to use Git from the console is a very valuable skill. Git offers a wide variety of functionality such as creating branches of the repository, temporarily stashing changes, and cloning repositories to other machines.

However, by using a tool like VS Code you can hide all of the complexity of the command line and use a visual interface instead.

Here we see VS Code, with the GitLens extension installed, looking at the directory we have been working in. On the left you see all the commits we have previously created. We can edit our `hello.txt` file and VS Code will automatically detect the change and set it up for us to commit. VS Code will even put a marking on the left side of the edited text to show us what line we have changed. We can click on the staged file, in the commit area, and see the differences before we commit. Since they look good, we add a comment, and press commit. The new commit immediately shows up in our list of commits. We can use the visual diff again to click through all of the previous versions.

![VS Code Git](essentialsVSCodeGit.gif)

Underneath the covers, the GitLens extension is running Git commands just like we did on the command line, but using a visual tool makes working with versions much easier. Take some time and play with adding files, modifying them, committing, and diffing. You want to get to the point where this is second nature so that you can easily experiment and make mistakes, knowing that with Git, you can always easily recover.

### create a git repo from GitHub
**git clone** "url"

### update changed files
**git add** filename
**git commit** -am "message"
**git push**

### get changes from GitHub
**git fetch** : get the latest info about changes on GitHub without actually changing your local repo
**git status** : see differences between clones and see if we are missing a commit
**git pull**  : pull it down from github

# Development and production environments

When working on a commercial web application, it is critical to separate where you develop your application, from where the production release of your application is made publicly available. Often times there are more environments than this, such as staging, internal testing, and external testing environments. If your company is seeking third party security certification (such as SOC2 compliance) they will require that these environments are strictly separated from each other. A developer will not have access to the production environment in order to prevent a developer from nefariously manipulating an entire company asset. Instead, automated integration processes, called continuous integration (`CI`) processes, checkout the application code, [lint it](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-linting-and-how-can-it-save-you-time/), build it, test it, stage it, test it more, and then finally, if everything checks out, **deploy** the application to the production environment, and notify the different departments in the company of the release.

![Complex deployment](essentialsDeploymentComplex.jpg)

For our work, you will use and manage both your _development environment_ (your personal computer) and your _production environment_ (your AWS server). However, you should never consider your production environment as a place to develop, or experiment with, your application. You may shell into the production environment to configure your server or to debug a production problem, but the deployment of your application should happen using an automated CI process. For our CI process, we will use a very simple console shell script.

![Simple deployment](essentialsDeploymentSimple.jpg)

## Automating your deployment

The advantage of using an automated deployment process is that it is reproducible. You don't accidentally delete a file, or misconfigure something with an stray keystroke. Also, having a automated script encourages you to iterate quickly because it is so much easier to deploy your code. You can add a small feature, deploy it out to production, and get feedback within minutes from your users.

Our deployment scripts change with each new technology that we have to deploy. Initially, they just copy up a directory of HTML files, but soon they include the ability to modify the configuration of your web server, run transpiler tools, and bundle your code into a deployable package.

You run a deployment script from a console window in your development environment with a command like the following.

```sh
./deployService.sh -k ~/prod.pem -h yourdomain.click -s simon
```

The `-k` parameter provides the credential file necessary to access your production environment. The `-h` parameter is the domain name of your production environment. The `-s` parameter represents the name of the application you are deploying (either `simon` or `startup`).

This will make more sense as we gradually build up our technologies but we can discuss our simon-service deployment script as an example of what they will do. You can view the [entire file here](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-service/blob/main/deployService.sh), but we will explain each step below. It isn't critical that you deeply understand everything in the script, but the more you do understand the easier it will be for you to track down and fix problems when they arise.

The first part of the script simply parses the command line parameters so that we can pass in the production environment's security key (or PEM key), the hostname of your domain, and the name of the service you are deploying.

```sh
while getopts k:h:s: flag
do
    case "${flag}" in
        k) key=${OPTARG};;
        h) hostname=${OPTARG};;
        s) service=${OPTARG};;
    esac
done

if [[ -z "$key" || -z "$hostname" || -z "$service" ]]; then
    printf "\nMissing required parameter.\n"
    printf "  syntax: deployService.sh -k <pem key file> -h <hostname> -s <service>\n\n"
    exit 1
fi

printf "\n----> Deploying $service to $hostname with $key\n"
```

Next the script copies all of the applicable source files into a distribution directory (`dist`) in preparation for copying that directory to your production server.

```sh
# Step 1
printf "\n----> Build the distribution package\n"
rm -rf dist
mkdir dist
cp -r application dist
cp *.js dist
cp package* dist
```

The target directory on your production environment is deleted so that the new one can replace it. This is done by executing commands remotely using the secure shell program (`ssh`).

```sh
# Step 2
printf "\n----> Clearing out previous distribution on the target\n"
ssh -i $key ubuntu@$hostname << ENDSSH
rm -rf services/${service}
mkdir -p services/${service}
ENDSSH
```

The distribution directory is then copied to the production environment using the secure copy program (`scp`).

```sh
# Step 3
printf "\n----> Copy the distribution package to the target\n"
scp -r -i $key dist/* ubuntu@$hostname:services/$service
```

We then use `ssh` again to execute some commands on the production environment. This installs the node packages with `npm install` and restarts the service daemon (`PM2`) that runs our web application in the production environment.

```sh
# Step 4
printf "\n----> Deploy the service on the target\n"
ssh -i $key ubuntu@$hostname << ENDSSH
cd services/${service}
npm install
pm2 restart ${service}
ENDSSH
```

Finally we clean up our development environment by deleting the distribution package.

```sh
# Step 5
printf "\n----> Removing local copy of the distribution package\n"
rm -rf dist
```

Can you imagine if you had to do all of that by hand every time? You would dread deploying and would most likely make several time consuming mistakes during the process.

A deployment script exists for each of the Simon projects and you can use them, as is, for your startup application as long as you are doing similar types of deployment actions.

If you want to learn more about shell scripting you can [read this tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php). Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating common development tasks and is well worth adding to your bucket of skills.

<summary>Technology Stack</summary>

# Technology stack

The collection of technologies that you use to create or deliver your web application is called a _technology stack_. It is a stack because they usually layer one on top of each other. Generally at the top of the stack is your web framework. This includes possibilities such as Angular, React, Vue, or Svelte. The web framework then communicates with one or more web services to provide authentication, business, data, and persistent storage. The web service then uses backend services such as caching, database, logging, and monitoring.

Here is what our stack looks like: React for the web framework, talking to Caddy as the web server hosted on AWS, running web services with Node.js, and MongoDB as the database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

![260 tech stack](essentialsTechStack260.jpg)

The key with a tech stack is the realization that there is no one answer to the question of what technology to use where, and the answer continually evolves. Usually you will use what the company you work for has invested in. Migrating to a new stack is very expensive and error prone. So learning how to maximize your effectiveness, regardless of the technology, will make you very valuable. Being discontent because the latest new toy is not being used, will usually cause an unnecessary disruption to the team. However, if you can validate that a change in the tech stack will produce significant monetary, performance, or security gains, then you will greatly benefit your team.

## Complex technology stack

Here is an example of a tech stack from a small web application company. You can see that there are dozens of technologies used to make the application work. When you build a commercial stack you want to be very careful about the pieces you choose. Dependability, support, scalability, performance, and security are all important factors. You also want to consider development productivity factors such as documentation, ease of use, common acceptance, community support, build times, and testing integration.

<summary>Web Servers</summary>

# Web servers

A web server is a computing device that is hosting a web service that knows how to accept incoming internet connections and speak the HTTP application protocol.

## Monolithic web servers

In the early days of web programming, you would buy a massive, complex, expensive, software program that spoke HTTP and installed on a hardware server. The package of server and software was considered the web server because the web service software was the only thing running on the server.

When Berners-Lee wrote his first web server it only served up static HTML files. This soon advanced so that they allowed dynamic functionality, including the ability to generate all the HTML on demand in response to a users interaction. That facilitated what we now know as modern web applications.

## Combining web and application services

Today, most modern programming languages include libraries that provide the ability to make connections and serve up HTTP. For example, here is a simple Go language program that is a fully functioning web service. Later on in the course we will show how this is done with JavaScript.

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	// Serve up files found in the public_html directory
	fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./public_html"))
	http.Handle("/", fs)

	// Listen for HTTP requests
	http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil)
}
```

Being able to easily create web services makes it easy to completely drop the monolithic web server concept and just build web services right into your web application. With our simple `go` example we can add a function that responds with the current time, when the `/api/time` resource is requested.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func getTime(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	io.WriteString(w, time.Now().String())
}

func main() {
	// Serve up files found in the public_html directory
	fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./public_html"))
	http.Handle("/", fs)

	// Dynamically provide data
	http.HandleFunc("/api/time", getTime)

	// Listen for HTTP requests
	fmt.Println(http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil))
}
```

We can run that web service code, and use the console application `Curl` to make an HTTP request and see the time response.

```sh
➜  curl localhost:3000/api/time

2022-12-03 09:50:37.391983 -0700
```

## Web service gateways

Since it is so easy to build web services it is common to find multiple web services running on the same computing device. The trick is exposing the multiple services in a way that a connection can be made to each of them. Every network device allows for separate network connections by referring to a unique port number. Each service on the device starts up on a different port. In the example above, the `go` web service was using port 80. So you could just have a user access each service by referring to the port it was launched on. However, this makes it difficult for the user of the services to remember what port matches to which service. To resolve this we introduce a service gateway, or sometimes called a reverse proxy, that is itself a simple web service that listens on the common HTTPS port 443. The gateway then looks at the request and maps it to the other services running on a different ports.

![Gateway](webServersGateway.jpg)

Our web server will use the application `Caddy` as the gateway to our services. The details of how Caddy works will be given later.

## Microservices

Web services that provide a single functional purpose are referred to as microservices. By partitioning functionality into small logical chunks, you can develop and manage them independently from other functionality in a larger system. They can also handle large fluctuations in user demand by simply running more and more stateless copies of the microservice from multiple virtual servers hosted in a dynamic cloud environment. For example, one microservice for generating your genealogical family tree might be able to handle 1,000 users concurrently. So in order to support 1 million users, you just deploy 1,000 instances of the service running on scalable virtual hardware.

## Serverless

The idea of microservices naturally evolved into the world of `serverless` functionality where the server is conceptually removed from the architecture and you just write a function that speaks HTTP. That function is loaded through an gateway that maps a web request to the function. The gateway automatically scales the hardware needed to host the serverless function based on demand. This reduces what the web application developer needs to think about down to a single independent function.

# Amazon Web Services - EC2

Now that you know all about web servers, it is time for you to rent your own. In theory you could contact your ISP and lease an IP address that you would then associate with your laptop. This would make your laptop into a web server, but this has the downside of requiring your laptop to always be available, have enough bandwidth to support your millions of fans, and creates a significant security risk for your laptop. Instead we want to use a cloud provider that can give you an inexpensive small computer that you can experiment with and throw away any time that you would like. This is actually exactly what many web companies do with their core business and so it should work fine for you.

When you rent a web server, it is physically located in a massive data center located in a place like Virginia, Ohio, Dublin, or Tokyo. Think of a data center as a very secure, climate controlled, warehouse that has hundreds of thousands of computers sitting in massive racks.

## Creating an AWS server instance

Assuming you already have an AWS account it is time to create your web server.

⚠ Note that the AWS interface changes all the time, so the images given below may not match what you see. However, the concepts they represent should all be there in some shape or form.

1. Open the AWS console in your browser and log in.
1. Navigate to the EC2 service.
1. Change your region (top right corner) to `US East (N. Virginia) - us-east-1`. Changing your region to N. Virginia will make it so that your server is located there. ⚠ This is crucial because the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) you will designate in a moment is only available in N. Virginia.
1. Select the option to `Launch instance`.
1. Give your instance a meaningful name. Perhaps use a convention such as [owner]-[purpose]-[version].

   ![AWS Instance name](webServerAWSName.jpg)

1. We have created an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for you to use as the base for your server. It has Ubuntu, Node.js, NVM, Caddy Server, and PM2 built right in so that you do not have to install them. Paste this AMI ID (`ami-0b009f6c56cdd83ed`) into the search box and press enter. Then select the `Community AMIs` tab. If no matches are found, make sure that your region is set to `US East (N. Virginia) - us-east-1` (You can check this by looking in the top right corner of the page).

   ![AWS Instance name](webServerAWSAmi.jpg)

   This should display the information about the class AMI. If the AMI ID matches `ami-0b009f6c56cdd83ed` select it.

   ![AWS class AMI](webServerAWS260Ami.jpg)

1. Select t3.nano, t3.micro, or t2.micro for the instance type depending on how much power you want, how much you want to spend, or if you qualify for a free usage tier. If you qualify for a free usage tier then pick that that instance type, otherwise choose the cheapest one. You can always change this later if your server is running slow and needs more power.

   ![AWS Instance name](webServerAWSType.jpg)

1. Create a new key pair. **Make sure you save the key pair** to your development environment. This needs to be safe in a place that is not publicly accessible and that you won't accidentally delete or commit to a GitHub repository. You will need this every time you secure shell (ssh) into this server (production environment). Note that you don't have to create a new key pair every time you launch an instance. You can use one that you created previously so that all of the servers you create can be accessed with the same key file.

   ![AWS Instance name](webServerAWSkeyPair.jpg)

1. For the network settings, make sure the `auto-assign public IP` address is enabled. For the `Firewall (security group)` select the option to `Create security group` if this is the first server that you are creating. Allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic from anywhere.

   If you have created a server before, then you already have a security group that you can use, and you should not clutter up your account with additional ones. In that case, use the option to `Select existing security group` and select the name of the existing security group.

   A security group represents the rules for allowing access to your servers. Security group rules specify both the port that is accessible on your server, and the source IP address that requests are allowed from. For example, you could allow only port 443 (the secure HTTPS port) from your development environment's IP address. However, doing so would mean that your web application would not be available from any other computer. You can learn more about security groups from the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html).

   ![AWS Instance name](webServerAWSNetwork.jpg)

1. If you are using a T3 class server you can take an advantage of the unlimited credit specification. If you are not using at T3 class instance you can ignore this step. In the `Advanced details`, change the `Credit specification` to `Unlimited`. This allows your `T class` (throttled class) server to keep using CPU running normally even though it has exceeded its current credit limit. You do incur a minimal charge for when this happens, but the alternative is to always spend more for a larger instance, or to have your server lock up when it hits the limit. For the minimal use that your server will see, you should not normally exceed your limit, but it is nice to not have your server die if you do. Even if you do temporarily exceed the limit, the charges will be mere pennies per hour.

   ![Web Server](webServerAWSUnlimited.jpg)

1. Select the option to `Launch instance`.

It will take a couple minutes for the instance to startup, but once it is marked as `running` it is close to being ready. Look at the properties for the instance and copy the public IP address.

Open your browser and paste the public IP address for your server in the location bar along with the prefix `http://`. For example:

```sh
http://3.22.63.37
```

If the server has started up, then you should see the following. Otherwise, wait a little bit and refresh your browser again. If the server is marked as running and it has been longer than 5 minutes, then there is a problem.

![Web Server](webServerAWSBrowserResult.png)

If that is what you see, then congratulations! You are now running your very own web server that the whole world can see! Time to celebrate with cookies.

## SSH into your server

Now, let's remote shell into your server and see what is under the hood. Go to your console window and use SSH to shell into the server. You will need to supply the public IP address (copied from the EC2 instance details) and the location of your key pair file that you created/used when you launched your instance. Hopefully, you saved that off to a safe location in your development environment; otherwise you will need to terminate your instance and create a new one, with a new key.

```sh
➜  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
```

For example,

```sh
➜  ssh -i ~/keys/production.pem ubuntu@53.104.2.123
```

⚠ You may get a warning that your key pair file permissions are too open. If so then you can restrict the permissions on your file so that they are not accessible to all users by running the `chmod` console command:

```sh
 `chmod  600 [key pair file]`
```

⚠ As it connects to the server it might warn you that it hasn't seen this server before. You can confidently say yes since you are sure of the identity of this server.

Once it has connected, you are now looking at a console window for the web server that you just launched and you should be in the ubuntu user's home directory. If you run `ls -l`, you should see something like the following. (Note that the dates might appear different.)

```sh
➜  ls -l

total 4
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ubuntu ubuntu   20 Apr 13 15:06 Caddyfile -> /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ubuntu ubuntu   16 Apr 13 15:06 public_html -> /usr/share/caddy
drwxrwxr-x 4 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Apr 13 16:48 services
```

The `Caddyfile` is the configuration file for your web service gateway. The `public_html` directory contains all of the static files that you are serving up directly through Caddy when using it as a web service. We will cover Caddy configuration in a later instruction. The `services` directory is the place where you are going to install all of your web services once you build them.

Once you are done poking around on your server, you can exit the remote shell by running the `exit` command. That is everything. You will only change a few configuration settings on your server in the future. With rare exception, all changes to the server are done using an automated continuous integration process.

## Keeping the same public IP address

You can stop your server at any time. Don't confuse this with terminating your server which completely destroys it. Stopping your server just powers down the device. This is nice because you don't have to pay for it while it is stopped. However, every time you stop and start your server, it will be assigned a new public IP address. It is important to keep the same public IP address so that you, and others, can always browse to the same place. More importantly, when you create your domain name, you can assign it to an address that never changes.

You have two choices in order to keep the same public IP address:

1. Never stop your server.
2. Assign an elastic IP address to your server so that it keeps the same address even if you stop it.

Your first elastic IP address is free. However, the catch is that it is only free while the server instance it is assigned to is running. While your server is not running you are charged $0.005/hr. This is the same cost for running a t3.nano server instance. So if you assign an elastic IP address, you don't save any money unless you running a more powerful instance, and are stopping your instance when you, or the TAs, don't need it.

We would suggest that you do both options. Keep your server running and associate an elastic IP. That way if you do need to reboot it for some reason, you will still keep the same IP address, and it doesn't cost you anything more either way.

Here is how you [assign an elastic IP address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) to your server instance.

1. Open the AWS console in your browser and log in.
1. Navigate to the EC2 service.
1. From the menu on the left select `Network & Security|Elastic IPs`.
1. Press the `Allocate Elastic IP address` button.
1. Press the `Allocate` button.
1. Select the newly displayed allocated address and press the `Actions` button.
1. Select the `Associate Elastic IP address` option.

   ![Elastic IP create](webServerAWSElasticIPCreate.jpg)

1. Click on the `Instance` box and select your server instance.
1. Press `Associate`.

Assigning an elastic IP address will change the IP address for your server, but it will not change again until you release the elastic IP address. If you do terminate your server and create a new one, you can again associate the same elastic IP address with your new server.

Note that your elastic IP address is allocated until your release it, not until you terminate your instance. So make sure you release it when you no longer need it. Otherwise you will get a nasty $3 bill every month.

## What size of server should you use?

The `t3.nano` instance size has just enough memory and CPU to meet the requirements of this course if you are careful. However, if you find that your server is running slowly or erratically, you should consider upgrading to a larger instance size. If you have an elastic IP address you can change your instance size whenever you would like and you won't lose your public IP address. You can even stop your server when no one is using it. This is useful because you don't get charged for your server when it is stopped.

<summary>Domain Names</summary>

# Domain names

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN What is a Domain Name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name)

In the instruction about the internet we showed how an IP address can be referenced by a domain name. You can get the IP address for any domain using the `dig` console utility. Notice that in the following example there are actually multiple IP addresses associated with the domain name `amazon.com`. This allows for redundancy in case one of the IP addresses fails to successfully resolve to a valid connection because the server listening at that IP address is not responding.

```sh
➜  dig amazon.com

amazon.com.		126	IN	A	205.251.242.103
amazon.com.		126	IN	A	52.94.236.248
amazon.com.		126	IN	A	54.239.28.85
```

A domain name is simply a text string that follows a specific naming convention and is listed in a special database called the domain name registry.

Domain names are broken up into a root domain, with one or more possible subdomain prefixes. The root domain is represented by a secondary level domain and a top level domain. The top level domain (TLD) represent things like `com`, `edu`, or `click`. So a root domain would look something like `byu.edu`, `google.com`, or `cs260.click`. The [possible list of TLDs](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tlds-2012-02-25-en) is controlled by ICANN, one of the governing boards of the internet.

![Domain name parts](domainNameParts.jpg)

The owner of a root domain can create any number of subdomains off the root domain. Each subdomain may resolve to a different IP address. So the owner of `cs260.click` can have subdomains for travel (`travel.cs260.click`), finance (`finance.cs260.click`), or a blog (`blog.cs260.click`).

You can get information about a domain name from the domain name registry using the `whois` console utility.

```yaml
➜  whois byu.edu

Domain Name: BYU.EDU

Registrant:
	Brigham Young University
	3009 ITB
	2027 ITB
	Provo, UT 84602
	USA

Administrative Contact:
	Mark Longhurst
	Brigham Young University
	Office of Information Technology
	1208 ITB
	Provo, UT 84602
	USA
	+1.8014220488
	markl@byu.edu

	dnsmaster@byu.edu

Domain record activated:    19-Jan-1987
Domain record last updated: 11-Jul-2022
Domain expires:             31-Jul-2025
```

This provides information such as a technical contact to talk to if there is a problem with the domain, and an administrative contact to talk to if you want to buy the domain. Maybe we should talk to Mark and see if he is willing to sell.

## DNS

Once a domain name is in the registry it can be listed with a domain name system (DNS) server and associated with an IP address. Of course you must also lease the IP address before you can use it to uniquely identify a device on the internet, but that is a topic for another time. Every DNS server in the world references a few special DNS servers that are considered the `authoritative name servers` for associating a domain name with an IP address.

The DNS database records that facilitate the mapping of domain names to IP addresses come in several flavors. The main ones we are concerned with are the `address` (`A`) and the `canonical name` (`CNAME`) records. An `A` record is a straight mapping from a domain name to IP address. A `CNAME` record maps one domain name to another domain name. This acts as a domain name alias. You would use a CNAME to do things like map `byu.com` to the same IP address as `byu.edu` so that either one could be used.

When you enter a domain name into a browser, the browser first checks to see if it has the name already in its cache of names. If it does not, it contacts a DNS server and gets the IP address. The DNS server also keeps a cache of names. If the domain name is not in the cache, it will request the name from an `authoritative name server`. If the authority does not know the name then you get an unknown domain name error. If the process does resolve, then the browser makes the HTTP connection to the associated IP address.

As you can see, there is a lot of levels of name caching. This is done for performance reasons, but it also can be frustrating when you are trying to update the information associated with your domain name. This is where the `time to live` (`TTL`) setting for a domain record comes into play. You can set this to be something short like 5 minutes or as long as several days. The different caching layers should then honor the TTL and clear their cache after the requested period has passed.

## Buying a domain name

You can pay to lease an unused domain name for a specific period of time. Before the lease expires, you have the right to extend the lease for an additional amount of time. The cost to buy the domain varies from something like $3 to $200 a year. Buying, or sub-leasing, an existing domain name from a private party can be very expensive, and so you are better off buying something obscure like `idigfor.gold` (currently available for only $101). This is one reason why companies have such strange names these days.

<summary>Route 53</summary>

# Amazon Web Services - Route 53

Referring to a web server by its IP address is fine for development, but it is not going to work for most users. Additionally, you want to create a secure (HTTPS) connection to your application, and that is not possible with just an IP address. Instead you want to use a domain name to represent your web application. That way you can make it easy to remember _and_ secure. In order for you to do this you need to buy a domain name, and then create DNS records with a DNS (Domain Name System) server.

`Route 53` is the AWS service that handles everything DNS-related. With Route 53 you can buy a domain name, host your domain on their DNS servers, and create DNS records.

⚠ You should already have an account with AWS from your work to rent a EC2 server instance. If you haven't done that work, go create your account and server following the previous instruction.

## Purchasing a domain name

AWS provides extensive documentation for all their services. You can find the documentation for [registering a new domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html) on their website. You may find the simplified directions below easier to follow, but if you run into trouble, or have additional questions, refer to the official documentation. Remember that you are leasing a domain name for a year, and so make sure it is a name that you would like. Also note that AWS credits do not apply to purchase of domain names.

1. Open the AWS console in your browser and log in.
1. Navigate to the `Route 53` service.
1. Select the `Domains > Registered domains` option from the menu on the left.
1. Push the `Register Domain` option.
1. Select the TLD that you want. AWS currently offers the `.click` TLD for $3 and `.link` for $5.
1. Put your desired root domain into the search box and press the `Check` button to see if it is available. Common one or two word phrases are almost always taken. For example, `260.click` is taken, but `webprogramming260.click` is not. Keep searching until you find one you like.
1. Press `Add to cart`.

   ![AWS Find domain](webServerAWSFindDomain.png)

1. Fill out the contact details. This information is sent to the authorized DNS registrar and is what shows up to the world for your domain name. Once registration is complete you can see this information using the console program `whois`. Make sure you fill in this information correctly. Providing false information may cause the registrar to revoke your registration.

   ⚠ If you are using new contact information that a registrar has never seen before, it will require you to verify the email address. Usually this means you will receive an email that you must respond to within 30 days. If you fail to do this your domain name will be removed from the registry without warning. Check your spam folder if you do not receive this email.

1. Press `Continue`.
1. Review everything and press `Complete Order`

It may take a while before your purchase is completed, but when it is the Route 53 service dashboard will show that you have a `hosted zone` for your domain name.

## Manage your DNS records

Now that you own a domain name you can use it to create DNS records that will map domain names to IP addresses (A records) or other domain names (CNAME records). For the purposes of this class, you want your root domain name, and any subdomain of your root domain, to map to the IP address of the web server you created previously.

You will need the public IP address for your server. You can get the public IP address by opening the AWS browser console and viewing the details of your server on the EC2 service page.

⚠ Note that the AWS browser console interface changes all the time; the directions below may not match exactly, but similar functionality should be there in some shape or form.

1. Open the AWS console in your browser and log in.
1. Navigate to the `Route 53` service.
1. Select the `Hosted zones` option from the menu on the left.
1. You should see your domain name listed here. If it doesn't then the registration did not complete, or it is still pending. In that case go review the information found under `Domains > Pending requests`.
1. Click on your domain name to view the details. This should display existing DNS records with types such as `NS`, and `SOA`.
1. First, create the root domain DNS record. This will associate your domain name with your server's IP address and allow you to use your domain name in the browser to navigate to your server.
   1. Press the `Create record` button.
   1. In the Value box enter the public IP address of your server.
   1. Press `Create records`
   1. A new `A` type record should appear in your list of records that represents the root domain name and your server's public IP address.
1. Next we will create a DNS record that will map to your server for any subdomain of your root domain name. This is possible because DNS allows you to specify wildcards for a DNS record.
   1. Press the `Create record` button.
   1. In the `Record name` box enter the text `*`. This wildcard represents that any subdomain will match this record, so long as it is not explicitly defined by another DNS record.
   1. In the `Value` box enter the public IP address of your server.
   1. Press `Create records`
   1. A new `A` type record should appear in your list of records that represents the wildcard subdomain name and your server's public IP address.

Your DNS records should look similar to the following when you are done.

![AWS DNS records](webServerAWSDnsRecords.png)

By defining both a record for your root domain and a wildcard record for any subdomain of your root domain you can now navigate to your server with either your domain name or a subdomain. For example, if you purchased the domain name `myfunkychickens.click` you could reach your server by navigating your browser to `myfunkychickens.click`, `simon.myfunkychickens.click`, or `startup.myfunkychickens.click`.

Open your browser and paste your domain in the location bar along with the prefix `http://`. For example:

```sh
http://myfunkychickens.click
```

This should show your web server's default page just like it did when you used the IP address.

![Browsing to hostname](webServerWithHostname.png)

Note that your browser will warn you that the website is not secure. We will resolve that in future instruction when we configure Caddy to generate a website certificate for you.

## Other record types

The additional `NS` and `SOA` type records that were listed for your domain name are important for working with DNS. These records were created automatically for you when you registered your domain name. The name server (`NS`) record contains the names of the authoritative name servers that authorize you to place DNS records in this DNS server. Those same authoritative name servers are listed with the registrar that you leased your domain name from. That way the authoritative name server can verify that the DNS records and the DNS registration match and are authorized to represent the domain name when defining DNS records. Otherwise a hacker could just add DNS records and take over your domain name.

The start of authority (`SOA`) record provides contact information about the owner of this domain name.

## Lease a domain name

1. Open the AWS browser console and log in.
1. Use Route 53 to purchase a domain name.
1. Set up your DNS records using Route 53. Make sure you have a record representing your root domain name, and a wild card subdomain.
1. Test that you can access your server using your domain name and any subdomain name.

Don't forget to update your GitHub startup repository notes.md with all of the things you learned and want to remember.

<summary>Caddy</summary>

# Caddy

![Caddy](caddyLogo.png)

Caddy is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests. Caddy then either serves up the requested static files or routes the request to another web service. This ability to route requests is called a `gateway`, or `reverse proxy`, and allows you to expose multiple web services (i.e. your project services) as a single external web service (i.e. Caddy).

For this course, we use Caddy for the following reasons.

- Caddy handles all of the creation and rotation of web certificates. This allows us to easily support HTTPS.
- Caddy serves up all of your static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. All of your early application work will be hosted as static files.
- Caddy acts as a gateway for subdomain requests to your Simon and startup application services. For example, when a request is made to `simon.yourdomain` Caddy will proxy the request to the Simon application running with node.js as an internal web service.

![Caddy](webServersCaddy.jpg)

Caddy is preinstalled and configured on your server and so you do not need to do anything specifically with it other than configure your root domain name.

## Important Caddy files

As part of the installation of Caddy we created two links in the Ubuntu user's home directory that point to the key Caddy configuration files. There links were created in the home directory so that you do not have to hunt around your server looking for these files.

- **Configuration file**: `~/Caddyfile`

  Contains the definitions for routing HTTP requests that Caddy receives. This is used to determine the location where static HTML files are loaded from, and also to proxy requests into the services you will create later. Except for when you configure the domain name of your server, you should never have to modify this file manually. However, it is good to know how it works in case things go wrong. You can read about this in the [Caddy Server documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile).

- **HTML files**: `~/public_html`

  This is the directory of files that Caddy servers up when requests are made to the root or your web server. This is configured in the Caddyfile discussed above. If you actually look at the Caddyfile you will see that the static file server is mapped to `/usr/share/caddy`. That is the location that the file link in the Ubuntu user's home directory, `~/public_html`, is pointing to.

  ```
  :80 {
        root * /usr/share/caddy
        file_server
  }
  ```

  Therefore, according to this configuration, whenever Caddy receives an HTTP request for any domain name on port 80 it will use the path of the request to find a corresponding file in this directory. For example, a request for `http://yourdomainname/index.html` will look for a file named `index.html` in the `public_html` directory.

# JavaScript Notes
<details close>
<summary>Console</summary>

The JavaScript console object provides interaction with the JavaScript runtime's debugger console. This usage of console should not be confused with your operating system's console (AKA terminal or command line). The console object provides functionality for outputting the value of text and objects, running timers, and counting iterations. These are useful debugging tools when you can actually execute your code in an interactive debugger (such as VS Code).

[Log](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/console/console.md#log)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic usage of the console object is to output a log message.

```source-js
console.log('hello');
// OUTPUT: hello
```

You can create formatted messages in the log parameter.

```source-js
console.log('hello %s', 'world');
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

You can even specify CSS declarations in order to style the log output.

```source-js
console.log('%c JavaScript Demo', 'font-size:1.5em; color:green;');
// OUTPUT: JavaScript Demo //in large green text
```

[Timers](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/console/console.md#timers)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are trying to see how long a piece of code is running you can wrap it with `time` and `timeEnd` calls and it will output the duration between the `time` and `timeEnd` calls.

```source-js
console.time('demo time');
// ... some code that takes a long time.
console.timeEnd('demo time');
// OUTPUT: demo time: 9762.74 ms
```

[Count](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/console/console.md#count)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see how many times a block of code is called you can use the `count` function.

```source-js
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 1
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 2
console.count('b');
// OUTPUT: b: 1
```
</details>
<details close>
<summary>javaScript to HTML</summary>

You can insert JavaScript into HTML either by directly including it in the HTML within the content of a `<script>` element, or by using the `src` attribute of the script element to reference an external JavaScript file.

index.js

```source-js
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

index.html

```text-html-basic
<head>
  <script src="javascript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="sayHello()">Say Hello</button>
  <button onclick="sayGoodbye()">Say Goodbye</button>
  <script>
    function sayGoodbye() {
      alert('Goodbye');
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

Notice that we call the `sayHello` and `sayGoodbye` JavaScript functions from the HTML in the `onclick` attribute of the button element. Special attributes like `onclick` automatically create event listeners for different DOM events that call the code contained in the attribute's value.

[Declaring variables](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#declaring-variables)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables are declared using either the `let` or `const` keyword. `let` allows you to change the value of the variable while `const` will cause an error if you attempt to change it.

```source-js
let x = 1;

const y = 2;
```

⚠ Originally JavaScript used the keyword `var` to define variables. This has been deprecated because they cause hard-to-detect errors in code related to the scope of the variable. You should avoid `var` and always declare your variables either with `let` or `const`.

[Type](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#type)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript defines several primitive types.

| Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Null` | The type of a variable that has not been assigned a value. |
| `Undefined` | The type of a variable that has not been defined. |
| `Boolean` | true or false. |
| `Number` | A 64-bit signed number. |
| `BigInt` | A number of arbitrary magnitude. |
| `String` | A textual sequence of characters. |
| `Symbol` | A unique value. |

Of these types Boolean, Number, and String are the types commonly thought of when creating variables. However, variables may commonly refer to the Null or Undefined primitive. Because JavaScript does not enforce the declaration of a variable before you use it, it is entirely possible for a variable to have the type of Undefined.

In addition to the above primitives, JavaScript defines several object types. Some of the more commonly used objects include the following:

| Type | Use | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Object` | A collection of properties represented by name-value pairs. Values can be of any type. | `{a:3, b:'fish'}` |
| `Function` | An object that has the ability to be called. | `function a() {}` |
| `Date` | Calendar dates and times. | `new Date('1995-12-17')` |
| `Array` | An ordered sequence of any type. | `[3, 'fish']` |
| `Map` | A collection of key-value pairs that support efficient lookups. | `new Map()` |
| `JSON` | A lightweight data-interchange format used to share information across programs. | `{"a":3, "b":"fish"}` |

[Common operators](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#common-operators)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When dealing with a number variable, JavaScript supports standard mathematical operators like `+` (add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), and `===` (equality). For string variables, JavaScript supports `+` (concatenation) and `===` (equality).

[Type conversions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#type-conversions)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript is a weakly typed language. That means that a variable always has a type, but the variable can change type when it is assigned a new value, or that types can be automatically converted based upon the context that they are used in. Sometimes the results of automatic conversions can be unexpected from programmers who are used to strongly typed languages. Consider the following examples.

```source-js
2 + '3';
// OUTPUT: '23'
2 * '3';
// OUTPUT: 6
[2] + [3];
// OUTPUT: '23'
true + null;
// OUTPUT: 1
true + undefined;
// OUTPUT: NaN
```

Getting unexpected results is especially common when dealing with the [equality](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness) operator.

```source-js
1 == '1';
// OUTPUT: true
null == undefined;
// OUTPUT: true
'' == false;
// OUTPUT: true
```

⚠ The unexpected results happen in JavaScript because it uses [complex rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#strict_equality_using) for defining equality that depend upon the conversion of a type to a boolean value. You will sometimes hear this referred to as [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) and [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) evaluations. To remove this confusion, JavaScript introduced the strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) operators. The strict operators skip the type conversion when computing equality. This results in the following.

```source-js
1 === '1';
// OUTPUT: false
null === undefined;
// OUTPUT: false
'' === false;
// OUTPUT: false
```

Because strict equality is considered more intuitive, it is almost always preferred and should be used in your code.

Here is a fun example of JavaScript's type conversion. Execute the following in the browser's debugger console.

```source-js
('b' + 'a' + +'a' + 'a').toLowerCase();
```

[Conditionals](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#conditionals)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript supports many common programming language conditional constructs. This includes `if`, `else`, and `if else`. Here are some examples.

```source-js
if (a === 1) {
  //...
} else if (b === 2) {
  //...
} else {
  //...
}
```

You can also use the ternary operator. This provides a compact `if else` representation.

```source-js
a === 1 ? console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');
```

You can use boolean operations in the expression to create complex predicates. Common boolean operators include `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not).

```source-js
if (true && (!false || true)) {
  //...
}
```

### [Loops](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#loops)

JavaScript supports many common programming language looping constructs. This includes `for`, `for in`, `for of`, `while`, `do while`, and `switch`. Here are some examples.

### [for](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#for)

Note the introduction of the common post increment operation (`i++`) for adding one to a number.

```source-js
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### [do while](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#do-while)

```source-js
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 2);
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### [while](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#while)

```source-js
let i = 0;
while (i < 2) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### [for in](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#for-in)

The `for in` statement iterates over an object's property names.

```source-js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 'fish' };
for (const name in obj) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: a
// OUTPUT: b
```

For arrays the object's name is the array index.

```source-js
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const name in arr) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: 0
// OUTPUT: 1
```

### [for of](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#for-of)

The `for of` statement iterates over an iterables (Array, Map, Set, ...) property values.

```source-js
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const val of arr) {
  console.log(val);
}
// OUTPUT: 'a'
// OUTPUT: 'b'
```

### [Break and continue](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/typeConstruct/typeConstruct.md#break-and-continue)

All of the looping constructs demonstrated above allow for either a `break` or `continue` statement to abort or advance the loop.

```source-js
let i = 0;
while (true) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i === 0) {
    i++;
    continue;
  } else {
    break;
  }
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

<summary>Strings</summary>
Strings are a primitive type in JavaScript. A string variable is specified by surrounding a sequence of characters with single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (```). The meaning of single or double quotes are equivalent, but the backtick defines a string literal that may contain JavaScript that is evaluated in place and concatenated into the string. A string literal replacement specifier is declared with a dollar sign followed by a curly brace pair. Anything inside the curly braces is evaluated as JavaScript. You can also use backticks to create multiline strings without having to explicitly escape the newline characters using `\n`.

```source-js
'quoted text'; // " also works

const l = 'literal';
console.log(`string ${l + (1 + 1)} text`);
// OUTPUT: string literal2 text
```

[Unicode support](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/string/string.md#unicode-support)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript supports Unicode by defining a string as a 16-bit unsigned integer that represents UTF-16 strings. Unicode support allows JavaScript to represent most languages spoken on the planet. This includes those that are read from right to left.

However, there are several important steps you must take in order to make your web application fully internationalized. This includes handling of currency, time, dates, iconography, units of measure, keyboard layouts, and respecting local customs. Read this [article on the W3C website](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/i18n) to learn more about internationalization.

[String functions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/string/string.md#string-functions)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The string object has several interesting functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| length | The number of characters in the string |
| indexOf() | The starting index of a given substring |
| split() | Split the string into an array on the given delimiter string |
| startsWith() | True if the string has a given prefix |
| endsWith() | True if the string has a given suffix |
| toLowerCase() | Converts all characters to lowercase |

```source-js
const s = 'Example:조선글';

console.log(s.length);
// OUTPUT: 11
console.log(s.indexOf('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: 8
console.log(s.split(':'));
// OUTPUT: ['Example', '조선글']
console.log(s.startsWith('Ex'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.endsWith('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.toLowerCase());
// OUTPUT: example:조선글
```

<summary>Functions</summary>
In JavaScript functions are first class objects. That means that they can be assigned a name, passed as a parameter, returned as a result, and referenced from an object or array just like any other variable.

The basic syntax of a function begins with the `function` keyword followed by zero or more parameters and a body that may contain zero or more return statements. The return statement may return a single value. Note that there are no type declarations, as the type is always inferred by the assignment of the value to the parameter.

```source-js
function hello(who) {
  return 'hello ' + who;
}

console.log(hello('world'));
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

A function without a return value usually exists to produce some side effect like modifying a parameter or interacting with an external program. In the following example the side effect of the function is to output text to the debugger console.

```source-js
function hello(who) {
  who.count++;
  console.log('hello ' + who.name);
}

hello({ name: 'world', count: 0 });
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

[Function parameters](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/functions/functions.md#function-parameters)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a function is called, the caller may choose what parameters to provide. If a parameter is not provided then the value of the parameter is `undefined` when the function executes.

In addition to explicitly passing the value of a parameter to a function, the function can define a default value. This is done by assigning a value to the parameter in the function declaration.

```source-js
function labeler(value, title = 'title') {
  console.log(`${title}=${value}`);
}

labeler();
// OUTPUT: title=undefined

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: title=fish

labeler('fish', 'animal');
// OUTPUT: animal=fish
```

[Anonymous functions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/functions/functions.md#anonymous-functions)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions in JavaScript are commonly assigned to a variable so that they can be passed as a parameter to some other function or stored as an object property. To easily support this common use you can define a function anonymously and assign it to a variable.

```source-js
// Function that takes a function as a parameter
function doMath(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

// Anonymous function assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(doMath(add, 5, 3));
// OUTPUT: 8

// Anonymous function assigned to a parameter
console.log(
  doMath(
    function (a, b) {
      return a - b;
    },
    5,
    3
  )
);
// OUTPUT: 2
```

[Creating, passing, and returning functions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/functions/functions.md#creating-passing-and-returning-functions)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are examples of assigning functions to variables, as well as using functions as parameters and return values.

```source-js
// Anonymous declaration of the function that is later assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// Function that logs as a side effect of its execution
function labeler(label, value) {
  console.log(label + '=' + value);
}

// Function that takes a function as a parameter and then executes the function as a side effect
function addAndLabel(labeler, label, adder, a, b) {
  labeler(label, adder(a, b));
}

// Passing a function to a function
addAndLabel(labeler, 'a+b', add, 1, 3);
// OUTPUT: a+b=4

// Function that returns a function
function labelMaker(label) {
  return function (value) {
    console.log(label + '=' + value);
  };
}

// Assign a function from the return value of the function
const nameLabeler = labelMaker('name');

// Calling the returned function
nameLabeler('value');
// OUTPUT: name=value
```

[Inner functions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/functions/functions.md#inner-functions)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions can also be declared inside other functions. This allows you to modularize your code without always exposing private details.

```source-js
function labeler(value) {
  function stringLabeler(value) {
    console.log('string=' + value);
  }
  function numberLabeler(value) {
    console.log('number=' + value);
  }

  if (typeof value == 'string') {
    stringLabeler(value);
  } else if (typeof value == 'number') {
    numberLabeler(value);
  }
}

labeler(5);
// OUTPUT: number=5

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: string=fish
```

<summary>Arrow functions</summary>
Because functions are first order objects in JavaScript they can be declared anywhere and passed as parameters. This results in code with lots of anonymous functions cluttering things up. To make the code more compact the `arrow` syntax was created. This syntax replaces the need for the `function` keyword with the symbols `=>` placed after the parameter declaration. The enclosing curly braces are also optional.

This is a function in arrow syntax that takes no parameters and always returns 3.

```source-js
() => 3;
```

The following two invocations of sort are equivalent.

```source-js
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// standard function syntax
a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
  return v1 - v2;
});

// arrow function syntax
a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);
```

Besides being compact, the `arrow` function syntax has some important semantic differences from the standard function syntax. This includes restrictions that arrow functions cannot be used for constructors or iterator generators.

[Return values](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/arrow/arrow.md#return-values)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arrow functions also have special rules for the `return` keyword. The return keyword is optional if no curly braces are provided for the function and it contains a single expression. In that case the result of the expression is automatically returned. If curly braces are provided then the arrow function behaves just like a standard function.

```source-js
() => 3;
// RETURNS: 3

() => {
  3;
};
// RETURNS: undefined

() => {
  return 3;
};
// RETURNS: 3
```

[This pointer](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/arrow/arrow.md#this-pointer)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, arrow functions inherit the `this` pointer from the scope of where it is created. This makes what is known as a `closure`. A closure allows a function to continue referencing its creation scope, even after it has passed out of that scope. This can be tricky to wrap your head around, and we discuss it in detail when we later talk about JavaScript `scope`. For now consider the following example.

The function `makeClosure` returns an anonymous function using the arrow syntax. Notice that the `a` parameter is overridden, a new `b` variable is created, and both `a` and `b` are referenced in the arrow function. Because of that reference, they are both part of the closure for the returned function.

```source-js
function makeClosure(a) {
  a = 'a2';
  const b = 'b2';
  return () => [a, b];
}
```

Next, we declare the variables `a` and `b` at the top level scope, and call `makeClosure` with `a`.

```source-js
const a = 'a';
const b = 'b';

const closure = makeClosure(a);
```

Now, when we call `closure` function it will output the values contained in scope where it was created instead of the current values of the variables.

```source-js
console.log(closure());
// OUTPUT: ['a2', 'b2']

console.log(a, b);
// OUTPUT: 'a' 'b'
```

Closures provide a valuable property when we do things like execute JavaScript within the scope of an HTML page, because it can remember the values of variables when the function was created instead of what they are when they are executed.

[Putting it all together](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/arrow/arrow.md#putting-it-all-together)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you know how functions work in JavaScript, let's look at an example that demonstrates the use of functions, arrow functions, parameters, a function as a parameter (callback), closures, and browser event listeners. This is done by implementing a `debounce` function.

The point of a debounce function is to only execute a specified function once within a given time window. Any requests to execute the debounce function more frequently than this will case the time window to reset. This is important in cases where a user can trigger expensive events thousands of times per second. Without a debounce the performance of your application can greatly suffer.

The following code calls the browser's `window.addEventListener` function to add a callback function that is invoked whenever the user scrolls the browser's web page. The first parameter to `addEventListener` specifies that it wants to listen for `scroll` events. The second parameter provides the function to call when a scroll event happens. In this case we call a function named `debounce`.

The debounce function takes two parameters, the time window for executing the window function, and the window function to call within that limit. In this case we will execute the arrow function at most every 500 milliseconds.

```source-js
window.addEventListener(
  'scroll',
  debounce(500, () => {
    console.log('Executed an expensive calculation');
  })
);
```

The debounce function implements the execution of windowFunc within the restricted time window by creating a closure that contains the current timeout and returning a function that will reset the timeout every time it is called. The returned function is what the scroll event will actually call when the user scrolls the page. However, instead of directly executing the `windowFunc` it sets a timer based on the value of `windowMs`. If the debounce function is called again before the window times out then it resets the timeout.

```source-js
function debounce(windowMs, windowFunc) {
  let timeout;
  return function () {
    console.log('scroll event');
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => windowFunc(), windowMs);
  };
}
```

You can experiment with this in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/XWxVBRx). In this example, the background color will change as long as the user is scrolling. When they stop the background reverts back to white.

<summary>Arrays</summary>
JavaScript array objects represent a sequence of other objects and primitives. You can reference the members of the array using a zero based index. You can create an array with the Array constructor or using the array literal notation shown below.

```source-js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(a[1]);
// OUTPUT: 2

console.log(a.length);
// OUTPUT: 3
```

[Object functions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/array/array.md#object-functions)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Array object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the interesting ones.

| Function | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| push | Add an item to the end of the array | `a.push(4)` |
| pop | Remove an item from the end of the array | `x = a.pop()` |
| slice | Return a sub-array | `a.slice(1,-1)` |
| sort | Run a function to sort an array in place | `a.sort((a,b) => b-a)` |
| values | Creates an iterator for use with a `for of` loop | `for (i of a.values()) {...}` |
| find | Find the first item satisfied by a test function | `a.find(i => i < 2)` |
| forEach | Run a function on each array item | `a.forEach(console.log)` |
| reduce | Run a function to reduce each array item to a single item | `a.reduce((a, c) => a + c)` |
| map | Run a function to map an array to a new array | `a.map(i => i+i)` |
| filter | Run a function to remove items | `a.filter(i => i%2)` |
| every | Run a function to test if all items match | `a.every(i => i < 3)` |
| some | Run a function to test if any items match | `a.some(i => 1 < 1)` |

```source-js
const a = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a.map((i) => i + i));
// OUTPUT: [2,4,6]
console.log(a.reduce((v1, v2) => v1 + v2));
// OUTPUT: 6
console.log(a.sort((v1, v2) => v2 - v1));
// OUTPUT: [3,2,1]

a.push(4);
console.log(a.length);
// OUTPUT: 4
```

[☑ Assignment](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/array/array.md#-assignment)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a CodePen that defines a function named `testAll` that takes two parameters. The first parameter is an input array. The second parameter is a tester function that checks all the values of the input array. If the tester function returns true for each value in the input array, then `testAll` returns true.

Call `testAll` with an array of strings as the first parameter and an arrow function that returns true if the input has a length greater than 3.

Output the result of the call to `testAll` with the `console.log` function.

Here is a template for you to start with.

```source-js
function testAll(input, tester) {
  const result = // Your code here
  return result
}

const result = testAll(/* Your parameters here */);

console.log(result);
```

Once you are done coding, submit your CodePen URL to the Canvas assignment.

<summary>JSON</summary>

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON)
- [Douglas Crockford: The JSON Saga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-JoyNuQJs)

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) was conceived by Douglas Crockford in 2001 while working at Yahoo! JSON, pronounced like the name Jason, received official standardization in 2013 and 2017 (ECMA-404, [RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259)).

JSON provides a simple, and yet effective way, to share and store data. By design JSON is easily convertible to, and from, JavaScript objects. This make it a very convenient data format when working with web technologies. Because of its simplicity, standardization, and compatibility with JavaScript, JSON has become one of the world's most popular data formats.

### Format

A JSON document contains one of the following data types:

| Type    | Example                 |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| string  | "crockford"             |
| number  | 42                      |
| boolean | true                    |
| array   | [null,42,"crockford"]   |
| object  | {"a":1,"b":"crockford"} |
| null    | null                    |

Most commonly, a JSON document contains an object. Objects contain zero or more key value pairs. The key is always a string, and the value must be one of the valid JSON data types. Key value pairs are delimited with commas. Curly braces delimit an object, square brackets and commas delimit arrays, and strings are always delimited with double quotes.

Here is an example of a JSON document.

```json
{
  "class": {
    "title": "web programming",
    "description": "Amazing"
  },
  "enrollment": ["Marco", "Jana", "فَاطِمَة"],
  "start": "2025-02-01",
  "end": null
}
```

JSON is always encoded with [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8). This allows for the representation of global data.

### Converting to JavaScript

You can convert JSON to, and from, JavaScript using the `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` functions.

```js
const obj = { a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined };
const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
const objFromJson = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(obj, json, objFromJson);

// OUTPUT:
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined}
// {"a":2, "b":"crockford"}
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford'}
```

Note that in this example, JSON cannot represent the JavaScript `undefined` object and so it gets dropped when converting from JavaScript to JSON.

<summary>Regular expressions</summary>

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)

Regular expression support is built right into JavaScript. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, you can think of them as textual pattern matchers. You use a regular expression to find text in a string so that you can replace it, or simply to know that it exists.

You can create a regular expression using the class constructor or a regular expression literal.

```js
const objRegex = new RegExp('ab*', 'i');
const literalRegex = /ab*/i;
```

The `string` class has several functions that accept regular expressions. This includes `match`, `replace`, `search`, and `split`. For a quick test to see if there is a match you can use the regular expression object's `test` function.

```js
const petRegex = /(dog)|(cat)|(bird)/gim;
const text = 'Both cats and dogs are pets, but not rocks.';

text.match(petRegex);
// RETURNS: ['cat', 'dog']

text.replace(petRegex, 'animal');
// RETURNS: Both animals and animals are pets, but not rocks.

petRegex.test(text);
// RETURNS: true
```

<summary>Rest and spread</summary>
📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN Rest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)
- [MDN Spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

## Rest

Sometimes you want a function to take an unknown number of parameters. For example, if you wanted to write a function that checks to see if some number in a list is equal to a given number, you could write this using an array.

```js
function hasNumber(test, numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

const a = [1, 2, 3];
hasNumber(2, a);
// RETURNS: true
```

However sometimes you don't have an array to work with. In this case you could create one on the fly.

```js
function hasTwo(a, b, c) {
  return hasNumber(2, [a, b, c]);
}
```

But JavaScript provides the `rest` syntax to make this easier. Think of it as a parameter that contains the `rest` of the parameters. To turn the last parameter of any function into a `rest` parameter you prefix it with three periods. You can then call it with any number of parameters and they are all automatically combined into an array.

```js
function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
```

Note that you can only make the last parameter a `rest` parameter. Otherwise JavaScript would not know which parameters to combine into the array.

Technically speaking, `rest` allows JavaScript to provide what is called variadic functions.

## Spread

Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following.

```js
function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
```

<summary>Exceptions</summary>
# JavaScript exceptions

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN try...catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)

JavaScript supports exception handling using the `try catch` and `throw` syntax. An exception can be triggered whenever your code generates an exception using the `throw` keyword, or whenever an exception is generated by the JavaScript runtime, for example, when an undefined variable is used.

To catch a thrown exception, you wrap a code block with the `try` keyword, and follow the try block with a `catch` block. If within the try block, including any functions that block calls, an exception is thrown, then all of the code after the throw is ignored, the call stack is unwound, and the catch block is called.

In addition to a catch block, you can specify a `finally` block that is always called whenever the `try` block is exited regardless if an exception was ever thrown.

The basic syntax looks like the following.

```js
try {
  // normal execution code
} catch (err) {
  // exception handling code
} finally {
  // always called code
}
```

For example:

```js
function connectDatabase() {
  throw new Error('connection error');
}

try {
  connectDatabase();
  console.log('never executed');
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
} finally {
  console.log('always executed');
}

// OUTPUT: Error: connection error
//         always executed
```

⚠ When first using exception handling it is tempting to use it as way to handle normal flows of execution. For example, throwing a `file not found` exception when it is common for users to request nonexistent files. Throwing exceptions should only happen when something truly exceptional occurs. For example, a `file not found` exception when the file is required for your code to run, such as a required configuration file. Your code will be easier to debug, and your logs more meaningful if you restrict exceptions to truly exceptional situations.

## Fallbacks

The fallback pattern is commonly implemented using exception handling. To implement the fallback pattern you put the normal feature path in a try block and then provide a fallback implementation in the catch block. For example, normally you would get the high scores for a game by making a network request, but if the network is not available then a locally cached version of the last available scores is used. By providing a fallback, you can always return something, even if the desired feature is temporarily unavailable.

```js
function getScores() {
  try {
    const scores = scoringService.getScores();
    // store the scores so that we can use them later if the network is not available
    window.localStorage.setItem('scores', scores);
    return scores;
  } catch {
    return window.localStorage.getItem('scores');
  }
}
```

<summary>Destructuring</summary>
📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

Destructuring, not to be confused with destructing, is the process of pulling individual items out of an existing one, or removing structure. You can do this with either arrays or objects. This is helpful when you only care about a few items in the original structure.

An example of destructuring arrays looks like the following.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 4, 5];

// destructure the first two items from a, into the new variables b and c
const [b, c] = a;

console.log(b, c);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2
```

Note that even though it looks like you are declaring an array with the syntax on the left side of the expression, it is only specifying that you want to destructure those values out of the array.

You can also combine multiple items from the original object using rest syntax.

```js
const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
```

This works in a similar manner for objects, except with arrays, the assignment of the associated value was assumed by the positions in the two arrays. When destructuring objects, you explicitly specify the properties you want to pull from the source object.

```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a, c } = o;

console.log(a, c);
// OUTPUT 1, ['fish', 'cats']
```

You can also map the names to new variables instead of just using the original property names.

```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a: count, b: type } = o;

console.log(count, type);
// OUTPUT 1, animals
```

Default values may also be provided for missing ones.

```js
const { a, b = 22 } = {};
const [c = 44] = [];

console.log(a, b, c);
// OUTPUT: undefined, 22, 44
```

Note that all of the above examples created new constant variables, but you can also use destructuring to reassign existing variables.

```js
let a = 22;

[a] = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a);
// OUTPUT: 1
```

<summary>Objects and Classes</summary>
A JavaScript object represents a collection of name value pairs referred to as properties. The property name must be of type String or Symbol, but the value can be of any type. Objects also have common object-oriented functionality such as constructors, a `this` pointer, static properties and functions, and inheritance.

Objects can be created with the new operator. This causes the object's constructor to be called. Once declared you can add properties to the object by simply referencing the property name in an assignment. Any type of variable can be assigned to a property. This includes a sub-object, array, or function. The properties of an object can be referenced either with dot (`obj.prop`) or bracket notation (`obj['prop']`).

```source-js
const obj = new Object({a:3});
obj['b'] = 'fish';
obj.c = [1, 2, 3];
obj.hello = function () {
  console.log('hello');
};

console.log(obj);
// OUTPUT: {a: 3, b: 'fish', c: [1,2,3], hello: func}
```

The ability to dynamically modify an object is incredibly useful when manipulating data with an indeterminate structure.

⚠ Note the different uses of the term `object`. Object can refer to the standard JavaScript objects (e.g. `Promise, Map, Object, Function, Date, ...`), or it can refer specifically to the JavaScript Object object (i.e. `new Object()`), or it can refer to any JavaScript object you create (e.g. `{a:'a', b:2}` ). This overloaded usage can be a bit confusing.

[Object-literals](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/objectClasses/objectClasses.md#object-literals)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also declare a variable of object type with the `object-literal` syntax. This syntax allows you to provide the initial composition of the object.

```source-js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};
```

[Object functions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/objectClasses/objectClasses.md#object-functions)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| entries | Returns an array of key value pairs |
| keys | Returns an array of keys |
| values | Returns an array of values |

```source-js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));
// OUTPUT: [['a', 3], ['b', 'fish']]
console.log(Object.keys(obj));
// OUTPUT: ['a', 'b']
console.log(Object.values(obj));
// OUTPUT: [3, 'fish']
```

[Constructor](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/objectClasses/objectClasses.md#constructor)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any function that returns an object is considered a `constructor` and can be invoked with the `new` operator.

```source-js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {name: 'Eich'}
```

Because objects can have any type of property value you can create methods on the object as part of its encapsulation.

```source-js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    log: function () {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    },
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

[This pointer](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/objectClasses/objectClasses.md#this-pointer)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice in the last example the use of the keyword `this` when we referred to the name property (`this.name`). The meaning of `this` depends upon the scope of where it is used, but in the context of an object it refers to a pointer to the object. We will talk more about the `this` pointer in the instruction on scope.

[Classes](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/objectClasses/objectClasses.md#classes)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use classes to define objects. Using a class clarifies the intent to create a reusable component rather than a one-off object. Class declarations look similar to declaring an object, but classes have an explicit constructor and assumed function declarations. The person object from above would look like the following when converted to a class.

```source-js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  log() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

You can make properties and functions of classes private by prefixing them with a `#`.

```source-js
class Person {
  #name;

  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.#name = 'Lie';
// OUTPUT: Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

[Inheritance](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/javascript/objectClasses/objectClasses.md#inheritance)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classes can be extended by using the `extends` keyword to define inheritance. Parameters that need to be passed to the parent class are delivered using the `super` function. Any functions defined on the child that have the same name as the parent override the parent's implementation. A parent's function can be explicitly accessed using the `super` keyword.

```source-js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  print() {
    return 'My name is ' + this.name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, position) {
    super(name);
    this.position = position;
  }

  print() {
    return super.print() + '. I am a ' + this.position;
  }
}

const e = new Employee('Eich', 'programmer');
console.log(e.print());
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich. I am a programmer
```

<summary>Local Storage</summary>

# Local storage

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

The browser's `localStorage` API provides the ability to persistently store and retrieve data (i.e. scores, usernames, etc.,) on a user's browser across user sessions and HTML page renderings. For example, your frontend JavaScript code could store a user's name on one HTML page, and then retrieve the name later when a different HTML page is loaded. The user's name will also be available in local storage the next time the same browser is used to access the same website.

In addition to persisting application data between page renderings, `localStorage` is also used as a cache for when data cannot be obtained from the server. For example, your frontend JavaScript could store the last high scores obtained from the service, and then display those scores in the future if the service is not available.

## How to use LocalStorage

There are four main functions that can be used with localStorage.

| Function             | Meaning                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| setItem(name, value) | Sets a named item's value into local storage |
| getItem(name)        | Gets a named item's value from local storage |
| removeItem(name)     | Removes a named item from local storage      |
| clear()              | Clears all items in local storage            |

A local storage value must be of type `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. If you want to store a JavaScript object or array, then you must first convert it to a JSON string with `JSON.stringify()` on insertion, and parse it back to JavaScript with `JSON.parse()` when retrieved.

## Example

Open your startup website and run the following code in the browser's dev tools console window.

```js
let user = 'Alice';

let myObject = {
  name: 'Bob',
  info: {
    favoriteClass: 'CS 260',
    likesCS: true,
  },
};

let myArray = [1, 'One', true];

localStorage.setItem('user', user);
localStorage.setItem('object', JSON.stringify(myObject));
localStorage.setItem('array', JSON.stringify(myArray));

console.log(localStorage.getItem('user'));
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('object')));
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('array')));
```

**Output**

```sh
Alice
{name: 'Bob', info: {favoriteClass: 'CS 260', likesCS: true}
[1, 'One', true]
```

Notice that you are able to see the round trip journey of the local storage values in the console output. If you want to see what values are currently set for your application, then open the `Application` tab of the dev tools and select `Storage > Local Storage` and then your domain name. With the dev tools you can add, view, update, and delete any local storage values.

<summary>JavaScript Promises</summary>

# Promises

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN Using Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)
- [MDN Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

JavaScript executes as a single threaded application. That means there is only ever one piece of code executing at the same time. However, the fact that it does not execute concurrently does not mean that it does not execute in parallel. You can asynchronously execute code with the use of a JavaScript `Promise`. Because the execution is asynchronous the promise object can be in one of three states at any given point in time.

1. **pending** - Currently running asynchronously
1. **fulfilled** - Completed successfully
1. **rejected** - Failed to complete

You create a promise by calling the Promise object constructor and passing it an executor function that runs the asynchronous operation. Executing asynchronously means that promise constructor may return before the promise executor function runs.

We can demonstrate asynchronous execution by using the standard JavaScript `setTimeout` function to create a delay in the execution of the code. The setTimeout function takes the number of milliseconds to wait and a function to call after that amount of time has expired. We call the delay function in a for loop in the promise executor and also a for loop outside the promise so that both code blocks are running in parallel.

```js
const delay = (msg, wait) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(msg, wait);
  }, 1000 * wait);
};

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Code executing in the promise
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    delay('In promise', i);
  }
});

// Code executing after the promise
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  delay('After promise', i);
}

// OUTPUT:
//   In promise 0
//   After promise 0
//   In promise 1
//   After promise 1
//   In promise 2
//   After promise 2
```

## Resolving and rejecting

Now that we know how to use a promise to execute asynchronously, we need to be able to set the state to `fulfilled` when things complete correctly, or to `rejected` when an error happens. The promise executor function takes two functions as parameters, `resolve` and `reject`. Calling `resolve` sets the promise to the `fulfilled` state, and calling `reject` sets the promise to the `rejected` state.

Consider the following "coin toss" promise that waits ten seconds and then has a fifty percent chance of resolving or rejecting.

```js
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
      resolve('success');
    } else {
      reject('error');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

If you log the coinToss promise object to the console immediately after calling the constructor, it will display that it is in the `pending` state.

```js
console.log(coinToss);
// OUTPUT: Promise {<pending>}
```

If you then wait ten seconds and the log the coinToss promise object again, the state will either show as `fulfilled` or `rejected` depending upon the way the coin landed.

```js
console.log(coinToss);
// OUTPUT: Promise {<fulfilled>}
```

## Then, catch, finally

With the ability to asynchronously execute and set the resulting state, we now need a way to generically do something with the result of a promise after it resolves. This is done with functionality similar to exception handling. The promise object has three functions: `then`, `catch`, and `finally`. The `then` function is called if the promise is fulfilled, `catch` is called if the promise is `rejected`, and `finally` is always called after all the processing is completed.

We can rework our coinToss example and make it so 10 percent of the time the coin falls off the table and resolves to the rejected state. Otherwise the promise resolves to fulfilled with a result of either `heads` or `tails`.

```js
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
